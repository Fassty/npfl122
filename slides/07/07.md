# Parallel Advantage Actor Critic

An alternative to independent workers is to train in a synchronous and
centralized way by having the workes to only generate episodes. Such approach
was described in May 2017 by Clemente et al., who named their agent
_parallel advantage actor-critic_ (PAAC).

The authors use $8$ workers, $n_e=32$ parallel environments, $5$-step returns,
$γ=0.99$, $ε=0.1$, $β=0.01$ and a learning rate of $α=0.0007⋅n_e=0.0224$.

The $\textrm{arch}_\textrm{nips}$ is from A3C: 16 filters $8×8$ stride 4, 32
filters $4×4$ stride 2, a dense layer with 256 units. The
$\textrm{arch}_\textrm{nature}$ is from DQN: 32 filters $8×8$ stride 4, 64
filters $4×4$ stride 2, 64 filters $3×3$ stride 1 and 512-unit fully connected
layer. All nonlinearities are ReLU.
