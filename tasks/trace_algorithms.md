#### Points: 4 points

Starting with the [trace_algorithms.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl122/tree/master/labs/09/trace_algorithms.py)
template, implement the following state value estimations:
- use $n$-step estimates for a given $n$;
- if requested, use eligibility traces with a given $Î»$;
- allow off-policy correction using importance sampling, optionally
  clipping the importance sampling ratios by a given threshold.
